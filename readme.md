# Traffic.YYC
### Introduction

This project demonstrates Node.js (Express) effectively to interact with a Calgary traffic API and the  client to display frequent update on rush hour on Deerfoot, Glenmore and Crowchild. 

### Get it running

This setup assumes you have an understanding of npm.

Execute the following on a terminal if you have git and npm installed.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/karshh/Traffic.YYC.git

Next, start up server.js

A command line output will state the URL which the server is listening on. Go on chrome and open up this URL.
